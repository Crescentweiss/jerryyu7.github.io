About Me
=====
I am currently a Ph.D. student in Intelligent System Engineering at Indiana University, focusing on computer science and engineering. My research interests include FPGA architecture, compression algorithms, and the development of GNN hardware acceleration. I am ambitious in combination of software algorithm and hardware architecture for realization of an innovative applicationn, based on my plenty of experiences in embedded system.

Education
======
* Ph.D student in Computer Engineering, Indiana University
* M.S. in Microelectronics and Solid-State Electronics, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2023
* B.S. in Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, 2020

Research Experience
======
* 08/2024-present: Research Assistant

  * Design a Novel compression algorithm for improving distributed GNN training process
    * Indiana University Bloomington
    * Duties includes: Worked on developing a communication-efficient compression algorithm to accelerate distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN) training. Focused on reducing communication overhead during feature and gradient exchange across nodes, while maintaining model accuracy. Contributed to algorithm design, performance analysis, and validation on large-scale GNN benchmarks.

  * Increasing Data Assignment for Efficient Large-Scale MoE LLM Inference
    * University of California, San Diego
    * Duties includes: Assisted in profiling expert activations across different MoE architectures and datasets. Created visualizations to analyze activation patterns and compared behaviors under different scenarios. Identified similarities and summarized key principles that can guide future chip-level optimization of MoE inference.

  * Design CXL-based system for cost-efficient multi-LoRA serving
    * University of California, San Diego
    * Duties includes: Helped profiling GPU performance under multi-LoRA inference workloads and identified key bottlenecks to support system-level optimization. Created visualizations of memory and compute utilization patterns to assist in the design of a CXL-enabled architecture for large-scale, cost-efficient LLM inference.

  * Analog Simulation for a Novel Machine Learning Design
    * University of Rochester
    * Duties includes: Leveraging the natural evolution of dynamical systems toward their optimal steady energy state- a property that can be harnessed to solve optimization problems. We designed a specialized analog circuit to accelerate both training and inference processes. To validate our initial design, we used capacitors and resistors to represent nodes and weights, connecting them via a dedicated circuit. In simulation, the system evolved to a final state that served as the inference result in the prototype.

  * Implementation onto FPGA for Scaling Data Compression Algorithm
    * Indiana University Bloomington
    * Duties includes: SZ compression algorithm is a lossy compression algorithm used for large data storage and communication. We designed an innovative algorithm in quantized stage to improve the parallelism for SZ3.0 compression algorithm, where a special architecture is designed to implement this improved algorithm on FPGA. As a result, a prototype as this initial feasibility architecture is verified.
